It provides a clear and concise way to implement SAM interface(Single Abstract Method)
by using an expression.
It is very useful in collection library in which it helps to iterate, filter and extract daata.

Lambda ex provide implementation of functional interface
(argument list) ->{body}

2) Arrow token: It is used to link arguments-list and body of expression.
3) Body: It contains expressions and statements for lambda expression.
