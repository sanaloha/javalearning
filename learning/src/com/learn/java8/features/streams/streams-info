Java provides a new additional package in java 8.
This package consists of classes, interfaces, and enum to allows functional style.
operations on the elements. You can use stream by importing java.util.stream package

Features:
1. It does not store elements. It simply converts elements from a source such as a data structure,
an array, or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of computational operations.
2. Stream is functional in nature, operations performed on a stream does not modify it's source. For example, filtering
a stream obtained from a collection produces new stream without the filtered elements, rather than removing elements
from the source collection.
3. stream is lazy and evaluates code only when required.
4. The elements of a stream are only visited once during the life of a stream, like an iterator, a new stream must be generated
to revisit the same elements of the source.
5. You can use stream to filter, collect, print and convert from one data structure to other etc. In the following examples,we have 
apply various operations with the help of stream.

Filters:
java stream provide a method filter() to filter stream elements on the basis of given predicate. Suppose you want to get only even
elements of your list then you can fo this easily with the help of filter method. This method can takes predicate as an argument and
returns a stream of consisting of resulted elements.

Streams can be used or consumed only once, once its used if someone try to use it again it will through an exceptio
