Overcome reflection issue: To overcome issues raised by reflection, Enums are used because
java ensures internally that the enum value is instantiated only once. Since java Enums are
globally accessible, they can be used for singletons. Its only drawback is that it is not 
flexible i.e it does not allow lazy initialization. 


===Serialization:
Overcome serialization issue:- To overcome this issue, we have to implement 
the method readResolve() in the singleton class.

====Cloning:
Cloning: Cloning is the concept to create duplicate objects. Using clone we can create copy
of object. Suppose, we create clone of a singleton object, then it will create a copy that 
is there are two instances of a singleton class, hence the class is no more singleton.  

Q. How can we avoid cloning?
