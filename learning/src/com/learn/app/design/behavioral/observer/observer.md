The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (called the Subject) changes its state, all its dependents (called Observers) are notified and updated automatically.
Think of it like subscribing to a YouTube channel: when the channel uploads a new video, all subscribers get notified. That’s the Observer Pattern in action.


Key Components
• 	Subject: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes.
• 	Observer: Defines an interface to receive updates from the subject.
• 	ConcreteSubject: Implements the subject and holds the actual state.
• 	ConcreteObserver: Implements the observer and reacts to updates


Why Use It?
• 	Promotes loose coupling between components
• 	Makes your system more extensible and event-driven
• 	Ideal for event handling, UI updates, or real-time notifications
Would you like to see how this pattern is used in frameworks like JavaFX or Spring? Or maybe compare it with the Publisher-Subscriber model?
