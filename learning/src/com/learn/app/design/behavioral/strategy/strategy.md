The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.
It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable—so the client code can
vary its behavior without changing its structure.

Why Use Strategy Pattern?
• 	You have multiple algorithms for a task (e.g., sorting, discounting, validation)
• 	You want to switch behavior dynamically
• 	You want to avoid conditional logic like  or Discount Strategies in a Shopping App
Let’s say you want to apply different discounts based on the occasion—Christmas, Diwali, or New Year.
