The Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects. It’s essentially a “factory of factories.”
When to Use It
• 	You need to create multiple related objects (e.g., UI components for different operating systems).
• 	You want to ensure that objects from the same family are used together.
• 	You want to isolate the client code from concrete implementations.

Real-World Analogy: Furniture Showroom
Imagine a showroom that sells Victorian-style and Modern-style furniture. You don’t want to mix a Victorian chair with a Modern table. So, each showroom (factory) produces a matching set of furniture.

Java Example: Cross-Platform UI Toolkit
Let’s say you’re building a UI toolkit that supports Windows and MacOS. Each OS has its own style of buttons and checkboxes.

1. Abstract Products
	.Button Interface
	.CheckBox Interface
	
2. Concrete Products.
	.WindowsButton 
	.MacButton 
	.WindowsCheckbox 
	.MacCheckbox 
	
3. Abstract Factory
	.GUIFactory Interface
	
4. Concrete Factories
	.WindowsFactory 
	.MacFactory 
	
Benefits
• 	Promotes consistency among related objects
• 	Supports scalability and flexibility
• 	Decouples client code from concrete implementations
⚠️ Drawbacks
• 	Can be complex to set up
• 	Adds extra layers of abstraction
