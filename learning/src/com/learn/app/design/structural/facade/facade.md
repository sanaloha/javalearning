The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It’s like a remote control for your home theater—you press one button, and behind the scenes, multiple devices coordinate to make it work.

The client interacts with one simple interface () instead of multiple subsystem classes.
• 	You can change internal implementations without affecting the client.
• 	Perfect for legacy systems, complex APIs, or multi-step operations.

The Facade Pattern is all about hiding complexity and providing clarity. It’s especially useful when:
• 	You’re integrating with legacy systems
• 	You want to simplify APIs for external clients
• 	You need to coordinate multiple subsystems
