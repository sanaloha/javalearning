java benefits of using buffer reader over File

1. Improved Performance
BufferedReader reads data in chunks (buffers), reducing the number of I/O operations. This makes it 
significantly faster compared to reading data byte-by-byte or character-by-character directly from a
 file.

2. Convenient Line-by-Line Reading
BufferedReader provides the readLine() method, which allows you to read an entire line of text at once.
This is much more convenient than manually parsing data when using a File object.

3. Memory Efficiency
By buffering data, BufferedReader minimizes memory usage and avoids frequent disk access, which can be resource-intensive.
4. Ease of Use
BufferedReader integrates seamlessly with other Java I/O classes like FileReader or InputStreamReader, making it easy to set up and use for reading text files.
5. Error Handling

It provides built-in mechanisms to handle I/O exceptions effectively, making your code more robust and easier to debug.
